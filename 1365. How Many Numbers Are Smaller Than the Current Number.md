# 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int[] nums) {
        //array arr is just the copy of the array nums, only difference is that array arr is sorted/
        int[] arr=new int[nums.length];
       //copying values from nums to arr
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            arr[i]=nums[i];
        }
        //after copying, sort the array arr.
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        //array ans stores the final answer that is to returned
        int[] ans=new int[nums.length];
        //this loops fills the array ans with the requres ans, see the below comment to understant how the search funciton gives us the answer to our question.
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            ans[i]=search(arr,nums[i]);
        }
        return ans;    
    }
    //The search fucntion uses the binary search approch to search throught the array quickly.
    //we take element from the array nums(orginal unsorted) one by one and search it's index in the array arr(sorted), then the index of the element in the sorted array gives the number of element which are smaller than it(NOTE: the index will be out answer only in the case of non-repitation, if there is we can counter that easily(look at #1)).
    
    int search(int[] nums,int element){
        int start=0;
        int end=nums.length-1;
        //the answer variable stores the index of the `element`
        int ans=0;
        while(start<=end){
            int mid=(start+end)/2;
            //(#1) now in the case that element at mid mathces the element being searched, two cases can occur.
            // 1) it is repeated
            // In the case of repeatition we will search the index of it's first occurence, because that will give the number of element strictly smaller that the required element.
           
            // 2) it is unique
            // Then the current index will give our required answer.
            if(nums[mid]==element){
                // now we have found the index of the requred `element` but we just cant return it, because it may not be that number is repeated, so we would store out potential answer in the `ans` variable and search on the left side of the array, if there is another occurence then the `ans` variable will be automatically updated.
                ans=mid;
                end=mid-1;
            }else if(nums[mid]>element){
                end=mid-1;
