# 1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side



## Approach:

We will traverse the array from the the end of the array and at each step we will keep note of greatest element encountered till now.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> replaceElements(vector<int>& arr) {
        //max element, since last element is to -1, therefore we initialised with -1.
        int max=-1;
        //last index.
        int end=arr.size()-1;
        while(end>-1){
            //storing the current element (to keep the copy of the current element so that we can use it to campare later).
            int temp=arr[end];
            //putting the values of the maximum(till now) element in the current position.
            arr[end]=max;
            //moving to the next element (to the left).
            end--;
            //if moving towards left reaches out of the array then break.
            if(end<0){
                break;
            }
            //if the copy of the present element is greater than the max element, then update the max element.
            if(temp>max){
                max=temp;
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
};
```
