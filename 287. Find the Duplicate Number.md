287. Find the Duplicate Number



This problem can be solved using two method depending upon the question asked.

**1)  IF CONSTANT SPACE O(1) IS REQURED AND LINEAR TIME O(N)**

we will use **cyclic sort** to sort the elelments and assign them their correct position and the element which won't be in the correct position after complete 1 pass will be the repeating element.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        //we create an index variable which runs throught the array nums
        int i=0;
        while(i!=nums.length){
            //checing if nums[i] is at correct postion or not,if it is then just move to the next index
            if(nums[i]==i+1){
                i++;
            }
            else{
                //if the number at index nums[i]-1(correct position of element nums[i]) and index 'i' is same, therefor it is the repeating element. 
                if(nums[i]==nums[nums[i]-1]){
                    return nums[i];
                }
                //else swap the elements
                else{
                int temp=nums[nums[i]-1];
                nums[nums[i]-1]=nums[i];
                nums[i]=temp;
            }}
        }return nums[nums.length-1];
    }
}

```



**2) IF ADDITIONAL SPACE IS ALLOWED BUT TIME IS LINEAR**



This is very fast method and should be used wheneven there is no restrictin of spafe complexity

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        //create an array which stores the frequency of elements in nums
        int[] ans=new int[nums.length];
        //traverse the array,
        //if the element '2' is found in the array nums then 'ans[2]'' increases by 1
        //therefore if some index say 'i' has ans[i]>1, that means that element was present more than once in the array nums.
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            //if the frequncy of nums[i] is already more than 1 therefore it must be the repeating element, returrn nums[i]
            if(ans[nums[i]]!=0){
                return nums[i];
            }
            //else increase the frequncy of index nums[i] in array ans.
            else{
                ans[nums[i]]++;
            }
        }return -1;
        
    }
}
```
