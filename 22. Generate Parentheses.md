[22. Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/description/)

# Method 1
The generateParenthesis function generates all valid combinations of well-formed parentheses using a recursive approach.

The helper function is a recursive function that builds the combinations by adding opening and closing parentheses to the curr string. It first checks if the curr string has reached the desired length of 2n. If it has, it checks if the string is a valid combination of parentheses using the isBalance function. If it is valid, the string is added to the answer list.

In the recursive case, the function adds an opening parenthesis to the curr string and recursively calls the helper function. After the recursive call, the function backtracks by removing the last added character to explore other possibilities. Then, it adds a closing parenthesis to the curr string and recursively calls the helper function. Again, it backtracks by removing the last added character. This process continues until all possible combinations have been generated.

The isBalance function checks if a given string of parentheses is balanced using a stack. It iterates over each character in the string, pushing opening parentheses onto the stack and checking for matching closing parentheses. If a closing parenthesis is encountered and the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not contain the corresponding opening parenthesis, the string is not balanced. Finally, if the stack is empty at the end, it means all opening parentheses have been matched with closing parentheses, and the string is balanced.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> answer = new ArrayList<>();
        helper(n, answer, ""); // Call the helper function to generate parenthesis
        return answer;
    }

    void helper(int n, List<String> answer, String curr) {
        // Base case: If the current string has reached the desired length (2n),
        // check if it is a valid combination of parentheses. If it is, add it to the answer list.
        if (curr.length() == 2 * n) {
            if (isBalance(curr)) {
                answer.add(curr);
            }
            return;
        }

        // Recursive case: Add an opening parenthesis to the current string and recursively call the helper function.
        curr += "(";
        helper(n, answer, curr);
        curr = curr.substring(0, curr.length() - 1); // Backtrack by removing the last added character.

        // Add a closing parenthesis to the current string and recursively call the helper function.
        curr += ")";
        helper(n, answer, curr);
        // curr = curr.substring(0, curr.length() - 1); // Backtrack (no need to remove the last character here).

    }

    boolean isBalance(String str) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Check if the parentheses are balanced using a stack.
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if (str.charAt(i) == '(') {
                stack.push(str.charAt(i));
            } else {
                // If a closing parenthesis is encountered, check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack
                // contains the corresponding opening parenthesis.
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek() != '(')
                    return false;
                stack.pop(); // Remove the matching opening parenthesis from the stack.
            }
        }

        // If the stack is empty at the end, it means all opening parentheses have been matched with closing parentheses.
        // Hence, the parentheses are balanced.
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```


# Method 2

1. `generateParenthesis` function:
   - Initializes an empty list `answer` to store the generated combinations.
   - Calls the `helper` function to generate the combinations recursively, starting with an empty `StringBuilder` `curr`.
   - Returns the `answer` list containing all valid combinations.

2. `helper` function:
   - Accepts the following parameters:
     - `n`: The number of pairs of parentheses.
     - `opening`: The count of opening parentheses in the current `curr` string.
     - `closing`: The count of closing parentheses in the current `curr` string.
     - `answer`: The list to store the generated combinations.
     - `curr`: The `StringBuilder` representing the current combination.

   - Base case:
     - If the length of the `curr` string is equal to `2*n`, it means we have formed a valid combination of parentheses.
     - Append the `curr` string to the `answer` list.
     - Return to backtrack and explore other possibilities.

   - Recursive steps:
     - If the count of opening parentheses (`opening`) is less than `n`, we can add an opening parenthesis to the `curr` string.
     - Append "(" to the `curr` string using the `StringBuilder`'s `append` method.
     - Make a recursive call to `helper` by incrementing the `opening` count by 1 and keeping the `closing` count unchanged.
     - After the recursive call, remove the last character from `curr` using the `deleteCharAt` method to backtrack.

     - If the count of closing parentheses (`closing`) is less than the count of opening parentheses (`opening`), we can add a closing parenthesis to the `curr` string.
     - Append ")" to the `curr` string using the `StringBuilder`'s `append` method.
     - Make a recursive call to `helper` by keeping the `opening` count unchanged and incrementing the `closing` count by 1.
     - After the recursive call, remove the last character from `curr` using the `deleteCharAt` method to backtrack.

   - By exploring all possible combinations of opening and closing parentheses using the recursive approach, we generate all valid combinations and store them in the `answer` list.

   - Once all recursive calls and backtracking are completed, the `answer` list contains all valid combinations of parentheses.

This approach efficiently generates all valid combinations of parentheses for a given `n` without the need for additional checks or string balancing operations.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> answer = new ArrayList<>();
        helper(n, 0, 0, answer, new StringBuilder());
        return answer;
    }
    
    void helper(int n, int opening, int closing, List<String> answer, StringBuilder curr) {
        // Base case: If the length of the current string is equal to 2*n,
        // we have formed a valid combination of parentheses
        if (curr.length() == 2 * n) {
            answer.add(curr.toString()); // Add the current combination to the answer list
            return; // Return to backtrack and explore other possibilities
        }

        // Recursive step 1: Add an opening parenthesis if the count of opening parentheses is less than n
        if (opening < n) {
            curr.append("("); // Append "(" to the current string
            // Make a recursive call by incrementing the opening count by 1 and keeping the closing count unchanged
            helper(n, opening + 1, closing, answer, curr);
            curr.deleteCharAt(curr.length() - 1); // Backtrack by removing the last character from the current string
        }

        // Recursive step 2: Add a closing parenthesis if the count of closing parentheses is less than the count of opening parentheses
        if (closing < opening) {
            curr.append(")"); // Append ")" to the current string
            // Make a recursive call by keeping the opening count unchanged and incrementing the closing count by 1
            helper(n, opening, closing + 1, answer, curr);
            curr.deleteCharAt(curr.length() - 1); // Backtrack by removing the last character from the current string
        }
    }
}
