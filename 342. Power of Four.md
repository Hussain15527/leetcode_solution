# 342. Power of Four

1. uses property of logorithm.

   Approach:

   let `n` be the given number

   $n=4^x$  --> $log2(n)=xlog2(4)$ --> $log2(n)=2xlog2(2)$ --> **$x=log2(n)/2$** 

   since we are talking about integral power, `x` must be an integer.

   so we have to check whether $log2(n)/2$ is an integer or not.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int a) {
        //4^x!=0 for any x.
        if(a==0) return false;
        //x-->power of 4, if n was a power of four.
        
        /*NOTE: we are only taking integral part of the whole expression, therfore it will give integral value when it shouldn't have
     	log2(4)=2
     	log2(5)=2 , since we are only considering the integreal portion of the log2().
     	
     	To overcome this we will reverse check whether the obtained value of the x, 
     	satisfies `4^x==n`, if it does then x is an power of 4, else it isn't.
     	*/
		int x=(int) ((Math.log10(a)/Math.log10(2))/2);
		
        //to check wheter x is the answer or not.
		if(isfour(4,x,a)) return true; 
            else return false;
    }
    static boolean isfour(int a,int power,int target){
		if(Math.pow(a,power)==target) return true;
		else return false;
	} 
}
```

2. Uses Bit Manipulation technique.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        //4^x!=0 for any x.
        if(n==0) return false;
        
        /*
        This solution requires basic observation of bits, specially binary form of multiple of 4's follows a certain property.
        
        4-->100
        16-->10000
        64-->1000000
        
        -we observe that every power of 4 have only 1 bit set (left most bit) 
        
        n&(n-1) unsets the first set bit from the left, including the set bit itself, if it 
        is applied of numbers whose  binary representation only have 1 set bit it will make 
        the number 0.
        
        n=4
        bin(4)=100 (n)
        bin(3)=011 (n-1)
        
        therefore, n&(n-1)=0;
        
        -we also observe that the bits are of odd length or more precicely, set bit (1) are 
        positioned at odd position if we look from the left side.
        
        NOTE: 0x55555555 is an hexametric number, which converts to 1010101010101010101010101010101 in binary.
        
        we observe this number is special, since every odd bit is set.
        This can differentiate if any number with 1 set bit is power of four or not.
        
        4-->0100 --> 4 & 0x55555555 = 4
        8-->1000 --> 8 & 0x55555555 = 0
        
        we can further show that for every power of 4, AND with this hexametric number gives a non zero value.
        
        -we know that 4^x>0 for every x.
        
        */
        return (n&(n-1))==0 && (n&0x55555555)!=0 && (n>0);
    }
}
```
