# 1. Two Sum

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        //This map stores the element as it's key and the index of the element as it's value.
        //so that it is easier for us to search for element and get it's index (.contains searches is O(1)). 
        Map<Integer,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            //if we are on the element `nums[i]` and map already contains the`target-nums[i]`,
            //then it means that it means we have already found our two answers.
            
            //Since the sum of nums[i] and target-nums[i]-->target.
            if(map.containsKey(target-nums[i])){
                //map.get(target-nums[i]) give the index of target-nums[i]
                //i gives the index of current element, that is nums[i].
                return new int[] {map.get(target-nums[i]),i};
            }else{
                //else just add the elements in the map, 
                map.put(nums[i],i);
            }
        }
        //if loop reaches this point it means that there is no answer, so just return empty array.
