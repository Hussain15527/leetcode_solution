41. First Missing Positive

leetcode question [https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive]()

we have to find the first postive number that is missing in the given array.
for example: 

```
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```

it is clear that '2' is the smallest/first positive number that is not present in the array.



**SOLUTION**

we can use the concept of cyclic sort by placing the number on their correct index (correct postion of *nums[i]* refers to the index *nums[i]-1*, for more clarification refer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfinxytTYFQ&t=4863s]()) 

NOTE: The elements which are:

1) negetive 
2) zero
3) greater than nums.length
4) duplicates

should not be bothered with, simply move to the next element (*i++*), because they dont have any correct position in the array anyways.

Rest of the elements should be placed in their correct index, by moving elements *nums[i]* to the index *nums[i]-1* 

**CODE**

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstMissingPositive(int[] nums) {
        
        int i=0;
        while(i<nums.length){
            //if element are negetive/greater than nums.length/duplicate/already in correct position
            if(nums[i]<=0 || nums[i]==i+1|| nums[i]>nums.length || nums[i]==nums[nums[i]-1]){
                i++;
            }
            //if element are not in their corrrect postion, swap them.
            else{
                int temp=nums[nums[i]-1];
                nums[nums[i]-1]=nums[i];
                nums[i]=temp;
            }
        }
        //check for first element which is in wrong index.
        for(int j=0;j<nums.length;j++){
            if(nums[j]!=j+1){
                return j+1;
            }
        }
        //if all element are in correct position then the answer would be next number to the largest number in the array.
        return nums.length+1;
    }
}
```
