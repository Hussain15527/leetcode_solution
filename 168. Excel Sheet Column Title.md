# 168. Excel Sheet Column Title

```java
class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int n) {
        //instead of string use stringbuilder so that addition of string takes less space and time
        StringBuilder ans=new StringBuilder();
        while(n>0){
            //since, during conversion from int to char we add 'A', which increases the 'actual' char to be appended, so before that operation we decrease the value beofrehand,
            //as to compensate for that addition of 'A'/
            n--;
            //n%26-->remender (gives the postion of letter just before the 'actual' letter, since we add an extra 'A', it gets corrected itself).
            ans.append((char)('A'+n%26));
            n/=26;
        }
        //since we converted the number to string from the back of the number, the string we got is reversed, so our answer is actually the opposite of the answer we got here
        return ans.reverse().toString();
        
    }
}
