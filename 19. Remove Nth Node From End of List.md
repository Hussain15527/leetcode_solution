[19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

# Method 1
## Explaination
This is a Java code for removing the nth node from the end of a linked list.

The input to the function is the head node of the linked list and an integer n. The function first checks if the linked list has only one node. If it does, then it returns null as there is no node to remove.

Next, the function traverses the linked list to find the length of the linked list. It does so by traversing the linked list until the node becomes null, incrementing the length of the list for each node it visits.

If the length of the linked list is equal to n, then the function removes the head node and returns the next node.

Otherwise, the function traverses the linked list again to find the (len-n)th node, where len is the length of the linked list. Once it has found the (len-n)th node, it updates the next pointer of this node to point to the node after the nth node, effectively removing the nth node from the end of the linked list.

Finally, the function returns the head node of the modified linked list.
```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    // If the list contains only one element, we cannot remove anything.
    // So, we return null as the head.
    if (head.next == null) {
        return null;
    }
    
    // Traverse the linked list to find its length.
    // We need to know the length to calculate the position of the node to remove.
    ListNode node = head;
    int len = 0;
    while (node != null) {
        node = node.next;
        len++;
    }
    
    // If we need to remove the head node, we simply return the next node as the new head.
    if (len == n) {
        return head.next;
    }
    
    // Traverse the linked list again to find the node before the one we need to remove.
    // We need to do this because we cannot directly access the previous node in a singly linked list.
    node = head;
    for (int i = 1; i < len - n; i++) {
        node = node.next;
    }
    
    // Remove the nth node by bypassing it and connecting its previous node to its next node.
    node.next = node.next.next;
    
    // Return the head node of the updated linked list.
    return head;
}
```

# Mehtod 2
## Explaination
This implementation uses two pointers, fast and slow, to traverse the linked list. The fast pointer is initially set to the head of the list, and the slow pointer follows fast with a delay of n positions.

Once the fast pointer has moved n positions ahead, we check if it becomes null. If it does, it means the node to remove is the head node. In that case, we return the next node as the new head, effectively removing the head node.

If the fast pointer is not null, we move both the fast and slow pointers together until the fast pointer reaches the last node. This ensures that the slow pointer points to the node before the one we need to remove.

Finally, we remove the nth node by bypassing it and connecting its previous node (slow) to its next node. We update the next pointer of slow to skip the nth node.

The function then returns the head node of the updated linked list.

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode fast = head;
    ListNode slow = head;
    
    // Move the fast pointer n positions ahead of the slow pointer
    while (n-- != 0) {
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    
    // If fast pointer becomes null, it means the node to remove is the head node
    // So, we return the next node as the new head
    if (fast == null) {
        return head.next;
    }
    
    // Move both the fast and slow pointers until the fast pointer reaches the last node
    while (fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    
    // Remove the nth node by bypassing it and connecting its previous node to its next node
    slow.next = slow.next.next;
    
    // Return the head node of the updated linked list
    return head;
}

```
