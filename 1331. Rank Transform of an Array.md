# 1331. Rank Transform of an Array



```java
class Solution {
    public int[] arrayRankTransform(int[] arr) {
        //create a TreeSet to store the element of the array `arr`
        //NOTE: TreeSet stores unique element in sorted manner.
        Set<Integer> set=new TreeSet<>();
        for(int x:arr){
            set.add(x);   
        }
        //create a map.
        Map<Integer,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
        //create a index variable 'index' to mimic the index of an element stored in the set, because there is no such thing as index related to set.
        //indexing starts from 1
        int index=1;
        //now store the element in the map, key-->element of the set(sorted), value-->'index' variable
        for(int x:set){
            //first element of sorted set will be stored with value as '1'(index variable)
            //second element of sorted set will be stored with value as '2'(index variable) and so on.
            
            map.put(x,index);
            //inrease the index by one.
            index++;
        }
        //'ans' array will be the array that will be returned.
        int[] ans=new int[arr.length];
        //the logic aplied here is that is if there is an element with index-value as 'i' then that means that there are 'i-1' element that are smaller than element at i, therefore it's rank is 'i'.
        
        //below arr[i] is server as the key to the map and the map returns it's value, which is it's index, which is also it's rank..
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            ans[i]=map.get(arr[i]);
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
}
```
