# 58. Length of Last Word

we start from the end and calucate the length of the last word.

```java
class Solution {
    //length variable
    int len=0;
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        //index starts from the end.
        int index=s.length()-1;
        while(index>-1){
            //if len is zero that means that we have only encountered spaces, during our traversal.
            if(len==0){
                //if it is still space then we move to the left again.
                if(s.charAt(index)==' '){
                    index--;
                }
                //if it's a letter, we increase the len variable and move left.
                else{
                    index--;
                    len++;
                }
            }
            //it means that the first element has been found.
            else{
                //if the element is space that means that the last word is traversed, and the length variable stores the length the length of the last word.
                if(s.charAt(index)==' '){
                    return len;
                }
                //if it's not space then the first word has not been fully traversed therefore we continue increasing the len of the array and continue traversing left.
                else{
                    len++;
                    index--;
                }
            }
        }return len;

        
    }
}
```
