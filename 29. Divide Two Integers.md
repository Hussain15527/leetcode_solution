[29. Divide Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/description/)

# Explaination
Here's how the code works:

1. It handles special cases where the dividend is the minimum value and the divisor is 1 or -1 to avoid integer overflow.

2. It determines the sign of the result by checking the signs of the dividend and divisor.

3. It converts the dividend and divisor to their absolute values and stores them in the variables `divid` and `divis`.

4. If the divisor is 1, the function returns the absolute value of the dividend multiplied by the sign.

5. The variable `count` is used to keep track of the quotient. The code enters a while loop as long as the absolute value of the dividend is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the divisor.

6. Inside the loop, it initializes `power` to 0 and increases it until the product of the divisor and the left-shifted divisor (`divis << (power + 1)`) becomes greater than the dividend. This determines the largest power of 2 that can be subtracted from the dividend.

7. It updates `count` by adding `1 << power`, which is equivalent to multiplying `count` by 2^power.

8. It subtracts the product of the divisor and the left-shifted divisor (`divis << power`) from the dividend.

9. Once the loop finishes, it checks if the result is greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and handles overflow cases accordingly.

10. Finally, it multiplies the result `count` by the sign and returns it as an integer.

Note: The code uses a long data type to handle potential overflow cases during the calculations.

```java
class Solution {
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        // Handle special cases where dividend is the minimum value and divisor is 1 or -1
        if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
            if (divisor == 1) {
                return dividend;
            } else if (divisor == -1) {
                return (dividend + 1) * -1;
            }
        }

        // Determine the sign of the result
        int a = dividend < 0 ? -1 : 1;
        int b = divisor < 0 ? -1 : 1;
        int sign = a * b;

        // Convert dividend and divisor to their absolute values
        long divid = Math.abs((long) dividend);
        long divis = Math.abs((long) divisor);

        // If divisor is 1, return the absolute value of dividend multiplied by the sign
        if (divis == 1) {
            return (int) (divid * sign);
        }

        long count = 0; // Quotient

        // Subtract divisor from dividend until dividend is less than divisor
        while (Math.abs(divid) >= Math.abs(divis)) {
            int power = 0;
            // Find the largest power of 2 that can be subtracted from the dividend
            while (divid > (divis << (power + 1))) {
                power++;
            }
            // Update the quotient by adding (1 << power) to count
            count += 1 << power;
            // Subtract (divis << power) from the dividend
            divid -= divis << power;
        }

        // Handle overflow cases
        if (count > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            if (sign == -1) return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }

        // Multiply the quotient by the sign and return it as an integer
        return (int) (count * sign);
    }
}


```
