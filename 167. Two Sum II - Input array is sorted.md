> We have been given a **sorted array** and we have to find index of two integers whose sum equals to **target**  

Best way to sole this question would be to use two pointers and find the elements using those to pointers.

Let the array be **nums = [2,7,11,15]** and the **target = 9**.
Let the **pointer_1 = 0** and **pointer_2 = nums.length-1**

There could be 3 possible scenarios:

1)  `nums[pointer_1]+nums[pointer_2]==target`

   we would simply return the these two pointers

2) `nums[pointer_1]+nums[pointer_2]>target`

   since this is a sorted array if we increase the `pointer_1` the sum would increase since there are greater element in the right side, so to decrease the sum we have to decrease the `pointer_2`

   `pointer_2--`

3) `nums[pointer_1]+nums[pointer_2]<target`

   using the same logic as above:

   `pointer_1++`



**NOTE: pointer_1 and pointer_2 has been replaced with start and end.**

**CODE**

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int start=0;
        int[] ans={0,0};
        int end=numbers.length-1;
        while(start<=end){
            if(numbers[start]+numbers[end]==target){
                ans[0]=start+1;
                ans[1]=end+1;
                return ans;
            }else if(numbers[start]+numbers[end]>target){
                end--;
            }else{
                start++;
            }
            
        }return ans;
    }
```
