# 28. Implement strStr()

```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        //return 0 if needle.length()==0
        if(needle.length()==0){
            return 0;
        }
        //start variable will traverse haystack
        //end variable will traverse needle
        int start=0;
        int end=0;
        
        while(start<haystack.length()){
            //if this condition is true that means that first element of needle has been found in haystack
            //as the loops run it will chech wheter other elements are same or not
            //if it is equal then increase both the index variable.
            if(haystack.charAt(start)==needle.charAt(end)){
                //as the loops run and the end index(traverse needle) reaches the end of the string, that means that all elements of the needle string has been found in haystack, therefore the answer has been found. 
                
                //observe that the first occurence of haystack will be the current index in haystack - the length of needle + 1 (since indexes are 0 based).
                
                 if(end==needle.length()-1){
                     return start-needle.length()+1;

                end++;
            }
            //if at some point an elements of haystack is not consistent with the element in needle, we would skip the current string being consider in the haystack and start over.
            
            //note that the end variable(traverse needle) will go to it's first element, since we need to start searching again.
            
            //and the start index will go till where the array has been already scanned.
