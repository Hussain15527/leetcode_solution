# 1051. Height Checker(leetcode)

Given a ``heigth`` array that contains the height of the student in the class, we have to find how many are in wrong postion when compared to it's *sorted* counterpart.

**Approach:**

we would create an array ``arr`` that would contain the frequency of the element in the array `height` and then use two pointers to check how many are in wrong postion.

Let the array `height` array be `[1,1,4,2,1,3]` then the `arr` will be `[0,3,1,1,1,0.....] ` where `arr[i]` represents the frequency of  integer `i` in the array `height`, note that the `arr` will be of size 101( maximum value of the integer that can be a element of `height`).



The algorithm is quite simple, let's assume that the `arr[i]` is the first non-zero element from left, that means that `i` should be the first element that should be present in the array height, if it is then coninue the traversal, if not then increase the count varible (variable that counts the misplaced element).

```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] nums) {
        //array that stores the frequecy of the element in the array height
        int[] arr=new int[101];
        //storing the frequency
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            arr[nums[i]]++;
        }
        //count-->number of mismatch
        //first-->pointer variable for the height array
        //seconf -->pointer variable for the arr array
        int count=0;
        int first=0;
        int second=1;
        
        while(first<nums.length){
            //if the arr[second]>0 that means that the `second` is present the array height.
            if(arr[second]>0){
                //if the element doesn't match the palce it should be on, increase the count variable, else don't
                if(nums[first]!=second){
                    count++;
                }
                // move to the next element in height array and decrease the frequency of current element by 1.
                arr[second]--;
                first++;
            }
            // `second` is not present in `height` array, so just move to the next element.
            else{
                second++;
            }
            
        }return count;
    }
}
```
