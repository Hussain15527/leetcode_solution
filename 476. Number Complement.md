# 476. Number Complement

```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        //ans is the variable to be returned
        int ans=0;
        int factor=1;
        while(num!=0){
            //right most bit 
            int bit=num&1;
            //if right most bit is 0 then add 1 the ans.
            //factor keeps track of the 2^n power to be multiplied when we convert binary to decimal format.
            //for right-most bit factor==1 (2^0)
            //for bit before the right-most bit ==2 (2^1) and so on.
            //Note: we don't have to care about addition of 0 to `ans` since it will automatically will be adjusted when we multiply the value of factor by 2 in each step.
            if(bit==0){
                
                ans+=1*factor;
                
            }
            // for ith bit from left, factor will be 2^(i-1). (1 based numbering).
            factor*=2;
            //right shifting to get to the next bit.
            num=num>>1;
        }return ans;
