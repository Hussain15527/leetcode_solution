# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        //counter variable to count number of steps.
        int count=0;
        while(num!=0){
            //checks if number is even or odd, if num&1==0 then it is even, else(if `1`) odd.
            int iseven=num&1;
            //if even then increase the count variable and then do right shift(divide by 2).
            if(iseven==0){
                count++;
                num=num>>1;
                
            }
            //if odd, then increase the counter by 2,
            //because according to our question if the number is odd then we would have to decrease it by one, 
            // but if we observe the, if n is even then `n>>1 == (n-1)>>1`.
            //because result must be integer it is ignoring any decimal values,
            //to us it seems like the compiler is decreasing the number and also dividing it by 2,
            // therefore performing 2 steps, hence counter+=2.
            
            //the edge case being when the number reduces to `1`, then in single division or subtraction it becomes 0, so it only requres single step.
            else{
                if(num==1){
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
                count+=2;
                num=num>>1;
