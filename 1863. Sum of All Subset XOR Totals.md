# 1863. Sum of All Subset XOR Totals

we use the fact that an array of length `n` has $2^n$ (including {} an empty).

Now let us look at the binary representation of number from  1 to $2^n-1$ (both inclusive) (since in this question we are not considering the empty set).

for n=5.
1--> 00001
2--> 00010
3--> 00011
.
.
30-->11110
31-->11111

If we write all the binary representaion of numberes from 1 to 31 ($2^n-1$) and consider that if `i`th bit is `0` then we wouldn't include the `arr[i]` in our subtring and if `j`th bit is `1` then inlcude the `arr[j]`, if apply this method, we would find that we can cover all the combination posisble for construction of a substring of an array (reason being that every element of the arr has only two option either to be included in the substring or not). 

```java
class Solution {
    static public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums) {
        //sum will store the final answer.
		int sum = 0;
        //size refers to total number of substring 
		int size = (1 << nums.length);
        //here `i` will act as the number that goes from 1 to 2^n-1, and bits of this number will determine which element goes to the substring and which doesn't.
		for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            //we calculate xor for every element of a subtring.
			int xor = 0;
            //j act as the bit, it is used to check if `j`th is set or not(from the right, 0 based index).
			for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
				//if the jth bit is set then, we calculate it's xor with other element of this substring
                if ((int) (i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
					xor = xor ^ nums[j];
				}
			}
            //we add the calculated xor the sum, and then procede to the next number.
			sum += xor;
		}
		return sum;
	}
}
```
